This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Logistic Regression is a widely-used statistical method for binary classification tasks, and it works by modeling the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class using the sigmoid function. The Breast Cancer dataset, available in Scikit-learn, contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass and targets indicating whether tumors are benign or malignant.

The process begins with data loading and preprocessing, including splitting into training and testing sets and standardizing features using z-score normalization. A Logistic Regression model is trained on the scaled training data. Model performance is then evaluated using various classification metrics such as the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify malignant tumors (true positives) and avoid false alarms (false positives).

Additionally, the model's output probabilities are visualized using a ROC curve, which helps in understanding the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity at various threshold settings. This project not only demonstrates how to implement logistic regression but also emphasizes the importance of performance evaluation in medical diagnosis tasks where accuracy and recall can have critical implications.
